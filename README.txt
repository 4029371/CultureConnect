## Project Scope (A1, A2, A3)
In response to the prompt "University Problems", CultureConnect took a deeper look at the issue of Racism and Discrimination within universisties. While racism and discrimination are far from restricted to university settings, it is without a doubt a growing concern, evidenced by efforts such as the first "Racism@Uni" national survey on racism in universities run by the Australian Human Rights Commission and the commencement of RMIT's Anti-racism Commitment Statement and Action Plan occuring earlier this year.
To completely resolve this highly systemic and pervasive issue is simply out of scope for the product. However, by honing in on some of the root causes of racism and discrimination in univerisities, I hoped to move the needle in the right direction. Specfically, I saw the lack of understanding between students of different backgrounds to be a key factor for misunderstanding and miscommunication. To the end of bridging this cultural gap, I thus propose CultureConnect, a way for students to ask and answer questions on a platform that takes inspiration from short form content that dominates digital attention particularly of younger demographics.
