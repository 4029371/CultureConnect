                Yes. Nasi lemak is literally coconut rice + sambal (chili paste) and we eat it at 8am before class.

                When I first moved here people were like ‚Äúhow are you eating chilli this early‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúhow are you eating cereal with no seasoning.‚Äù

                But also: not every region eats it super spicy. My family tones it down a bit because my mum can‚Äôt handle heat.

                Short answer: No. We think it's cute and respectful 90% of the time.

                The only time it's weird is if you ignore when we try to switch to English to help you, and you keep forcing it like it's a performance.

                So: try, but also read the vibe.
